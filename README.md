Assistop is an IoT Governor. It is designed to enhance the security of home assistants integrated within Smart Homes. When a user is not at home, it disables the assistants from being able to make critical changes.

## Getting Started
Download the git repo and run the installation script as sudo `sudo ./install.sh` where it will run through a set of instructions and only prompt you to reboot.

This will create a new wifi network called Assistop with the default password of ChangeMe
